# Coding assignment "Learn Basic JavaScript Programming" Function Module
## Description 
### There are 1 main.js programs as follows:
#### * Coding Quiz: Function (main.js)
This program consists of two tasks (TODO):
TODO 1: Create a minimal function that accepts two numeric arguments, a and b, and returns the smallest value between a or b. If both values are equal, it returns the value of a.
TODO 2: Create a findIndex function that accepts two parameters, an array and a number. This function should return the index of the corresponding number in the array. If the number is not found, it returns a value of -1.
The purpose of this program is to create two functions that can each perform a special operation, namely finding the smallest value between two numbers (minimum) and finding the index of a number in an array (findIndex).
So, this program is a JavaScript script that defines two functions, minimal and findIndex, to perform special operations according to the descriptions given in the comments. These functions are then tested using some example cases and the results are displayed using console.log().
